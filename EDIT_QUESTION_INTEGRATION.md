# Edit Question Feature Integration - Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the `EditQuestionModal` component into the `FilterQuestionsPage.tsx` to allow editing questions from the filtered results display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates
- ✅ Added `QuestionUpdateRequestBody` schema in `question.py`
- ✅ Created `update_question_in_db` service function in `question_service.py`
- ✅ Added `PUT /questions/{question_id}` endpoint in `question_controller.py`

### 2. Frontend API Integration
- ✅ Added `QuestionUpdateRequestBody` interface in `interface.ts`
- ✅ Created `updateQuestion` API function in `openAiService.ts`

### 3. FilteredQuestions Component Updates
- ✅ Added edit button to each question card
- ✅ Added `onEditQuestion` prop to handle edit clicks
- ✅ Renamed interface from `GeneratedQuestionsProps` to `FilteredQuestionsProps` to avoid conflicts

### 4. FilterQuestionsPage Integration
- ✅ Added `EditQuestionModal` import and state management
- ✅ Created `handleEditQuestion` function to open modal with selected question
- ✅ Created `handleSaveEditedQuestion` function to update questions via API
- ✅ Added modal component to JSX with proper props
- ✅ Integrated edit functionality with existing filtered questions display

### 5. Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed interface naming conflicts between different components
- ✅ Added missing `onEditQuestion` prop to `SympyGenPage.tsx` to maintain compatibility

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Edit Question" button** on any filtered question card
2. **Modal opens** with the current question data pre-populated
3. **User modifies** question text, answers, MCQ options, etc. in the modal
4. **User saves changes** which triggers API call to update the question in database
5. **Local state updates** to reflect changes immediately in the UI
6. **Success notification** confirms the update

## Key Features

- **Partial Updates**: Only modified fields are sent to the backend
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Changes reflect immediately without page refresh
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for failed updates
- **Validation**: Backend validates question ID existence before updates
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

## API Endpoint Usage

```bash
PUT /api/v1/questions/{question_id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "question": "Updated question text",
  "correctAnswer": "Updated answer",
  "detailedAnswer": "Updated detailed explanation",
  "mcqAnswers": ["option1", "option2", "option3", "option4"],
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
}
```
